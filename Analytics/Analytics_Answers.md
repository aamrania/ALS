Questions:

1.    The gift/clicks ratio went from `2.95%` in **only you** to `7.62%` in **before midnight**. Hence the percentage increase x is such as `2.95(1+x)=7.62` which means `x=1.58=158%` 													

2. If the gift/open ratio held steady in the **before midnight** email, then in order to reach `300` gifts, we should have x opens such as $\frac{224}{66396}=300/x$. Hence, x = 88924													

3. The email performance is directly indicated by money raised. The number of gifts (and subsequently gifts/sent, gifts/opens, gifts/clicks, average gift) are less relevant as they can be influenced													
    by the email's rhetoric. If we consider the remaining metrics (Total Raised, Open Rate, Clicks/Sent, Clicks/Opens), the "Only You" email is the most performant, then "before midnight" then "got a sec"													

4. The "one more minute" message have seen both "Total Raised" and "Average Gift" decline. Hence, the client should be concerned by the drop in average gift and has to review the rhetoric 													
    because if the goal was to have more smaller gifts, the company didn't achieve the same total amount as in the "this is crazy" message													

5. The response rate for the "one more minute" is (0.12/0.08-1)=50% higher than the "can't stop hitting refresh" message. If we assume that a much better rate means at least 30% increase,													
    then "one more minute" rate is much better than the "can't stop hitting refresh" one.
